# bayesian-ml

In this repo, I will be implementing some fundamental statistical machine learning algorithms; this is for my own education. Since my work/research is current trending toward more statistical and, in particular, Bayesian models, this is the focus of these algorithms. 

My goal is to write notebooks which combine documentation and readable descriptions of the various algorithms with simple Python and maybe Julia code implementing them. Libraries like PyMC3 and Pytorch/Pyro will also probably be used at some point to abstract away from the lower-level details of these algorithms, since these libraries treat the algorithms like black boxes into which we just plug our models and data. To start, though, I want to understand these algorithms.
